# tinyproto
The aim of this tool to build small fast protobuf parsers for Typescript. Parsers generated by the tool will be naive. In particular there is no 64-bit number support, and no attempt at validation. These parsers are not guaranteed to follow the Protobuf spec. 

If you have any issues with the output of this tool then switch to using a more complete and compliant tool such as the excellent 
https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js/

##Usage

##Advantages
They will however offer some advantages over a more complete approach:
* Small file size, and fast run speed which is crucial to using protobuf format data in bulk on page load. 
* Enabling you to define an appropriate class to create on parse should also reduce the need for wrapping, and hopefully create a smaller memory footprint for data and cheaper GC
* Add in ability to set parameters like DPs so that decimal numbers can be passed as integers and the information about magnitude will not be lost, or to define ad-hoc post parse stages

##Architecture
Generation is done by feeding a .proto file into a Java parser. This was developed using Antlr 4. The .g4 file for parsing .proto files was adapted from an Antlr 3 grammar provided in another OS project, which will be credited as soon as I find a link. This approach should allow addition of other languages. I'd like to produce a smaller footprint Java library with Java 8 
support for example
